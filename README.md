## Project Description: Customer Retail Classification on Purchase History using AI


### Objectives
- Build a reliable classification model.
- Preprocess and analyze purchase history data.
- Achieve high accuracy through evaluation and fine-tuning.

### Dataset
Use a retail dataset with customer purchase histories, including transaction details, product categories, and purchase amounts.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Collect, inspect, and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract features like purchase frequency, average spend, and product preferences.
   - Use clustering or RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
3. **Model Training**
   - Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks).
   - Split data into training and validation sets.
   - Train and validate the model.
4. **Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
5. **Deployment**
   - Save and deploy the model for customer segmentation and marketing strategies.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Quality:** Clean data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Selection:** Use domain knowledge and statistical methods.
- **Model Performance:** Fine-tune hyperparameters and use ensemble methods.

### Outcomes
